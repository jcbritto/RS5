 * Implementation of a 32-bit addition coprocessor plugin for RS5
 *
 * \brief
 * Hardware accelerator plugin that performs 32-bit addition A + B + 5
 *
 * \detailed
 * This module implements a simple single-cycle coprocessor that:
 * - Receives two 32-bit operands (operand_a, operand_b)
 * - Performs addition operation: operand_a + operand_b + 5
 * - Provides immediate result (combinational logic)
 * - Single-cycle operation for RISC-V pipeline compatibility
